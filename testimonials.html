                    <h4 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">-F. Jeddy | Morgan Hill</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">Normally my better half cooks everything that we serve at our home parties,
                        however this time we decided to have Ladle n Wok (LnW) help. This was primarily for two reasons:<br><br>

                        1. We wanted a specific theme for the decor and our own creativity for theme decor is a bit
                        limited 😊<br>
                        2. Wanted to enjoy the party and not spend hours and hours cooking, and then serving.<br><br>

                        The key thing here is that the food taste and quality need to be really good because otherwise
                        kaafi sharmindagi ho sakti hai. Heard and saw a lot about LnW on this group so decided to try
                        their catering.<br><br>

                        Once we finalized the date of the party, and synced up with LnW, from there it turned into an
                        incredibly smooth process. They helped us decide on the menu, understood the theme we wanted,
                        and then took care of everything. We basically gave them just an overview of the theme, and did
                        not micromanage any of it - and let them come up with creative ideas - and they absolutely
                        nailed it - surprised and delighted us with their execution.
                        <br><br>

                        Our menu was:
                        <br>

                        Appetizers:<br>
                        - Pani Puri<br>
                        - Cranberry Cream Cheese dip
                        <br><br>
                        Main Courses:<br>
                        - Greek Salad<br>
                        - Chicken Biryani<br>
                        - Beef Nihari<br>
                        - Lahori Chargha<br>
                        - Dhaba Daal<br>
                        - Naan
                        <br><br>
                        And also Kashmiri Chai<br><br>

                        On the day of the party, they arrived a few hours prior, set up the whole decor, they had
                        pre-printed all the food titles, all the food came in fully prepared and piping hot, the final
                        touches were done at our home, and all the props were ready and the food was served hot.<br><br>

                        The appetizers looked good and provided an easy ice-breaker for the goodness that was to follow.
                        They were deliberately selected so they were not supremely filling, which means everyone
                        retained their appetite for the main course, but at the same time, the appetizers allowed
                        everyone to snack a bit over gupshup. The cholay of pani puri were nicely marinated and had a
                        good kick, while the pani was not very sour/khatta - so everyone was able to take multiple
                        servings.<br><br>

                        Then on to the main course. We went with a more traditional desi menu. Everyone raved about the
                        beef nihari since it had a real authentic taste - and as many of us know, getting the nihari
                        right can be very tricky. Nihari had good pieces of boong ka gosht, which is very key.<br><br>

                        Chicken Biryani was very nice. High-quality rice and expertly cooked.
                        The surprising star of the show was Dhaba Daal. It was kickass. As we all know, Muslims are
                        generally highly carnivorous and only want to focus on meat dishes, but this daal hooked
                        everyone that tried it, and everyone was coming back for seconds.<br><br>

                        The best thing about chargha was that it was expertly cooked and the quantity was never an
                        issue. For a party of about 25 guests, they brought 4 charghas, which meant no one had to stop
                        their hand in going for second or thirds.<br><br>

                        Kashmiri chai had a real authentic taste, and the right color, and everyone loved the taste. The
                        best thing is that it was not highly sweetened. It had the right level of salt and sugar
                        balance.<br><br>

                        From a pricing perspective, the food was actually very reasonably priced. Quantity was
                        plentiful. They did charge separately for theme and decor, and once we saw all the props, etc
                        that they brought, it felt quite reasonable too.

                        Arifa/Sarah and their entire entourage were highly organized and effectively
                        delivered on a very tight schedule. They were cool and focused throughout the event.

                        The setup was beautiful and was the talk of the party.
                        Linens, table setting, Photo booth/ring, setting up a multitude of dinner settings
                        and desserts were all executed to the “T”.

                        I received a ton of compliments on the food as well, a lot of people took your
                        information and I hope you get some business from it.

                        You and your team executed beyond my expectations. I look forward to working with
                        you and your team again in the future.
                        Thank you again for your outstanding service!!!!

                        We chose ladle n wok to do my High Chai bridal shower inspired by a tea party scene from A
                        Little Princess. I was blown away by what an amazing job they did. The decor was spot on with
                        the movie scene. It was elegant and magical. Their attention to detail is impeccable. You can
                        feel that they love and enjoy what they do and that shows in their execution. The food was
                        delicious as well! The chicken paratha rolls were a favorite as well as the egg salad
                        sandwiches. The cake was stunning and super tasty! I can't say enough about how wonderful
                        everything turned out!</p>

                        I chose Ladle n Wok for catering and decorating my Nikah ceremony in July. During the whole
                        process they were extremely professional, responsive and patient in answering all my questions.
                        They took care of everything smoothly on my wedding day.

                        The entire team was lovely to work with. The decor was phenomenal! They considered every detail
                        and it looked beautiful. They even accommodated a few last minute changes which I really
                        appreciated. A lot of my guests highly complimented the decor.

                        The food was delicious as well. I loved the variety in their menu options. The mango mousse,
                        firni and Nihari were among our family and guest favorites!

                        enjoy day of the event because they took care of everything so well. So nice to have reliable
                        caters who make exceptionally yummy food. Their food have always been a hit with us, but their
                        theme based menu was so pretty and so delicious. Loved working with them</p>

                    <p class="card-text">I want to tell everyone of our experience hiring Ladle n Wok for
                        providing catering services for our wedding (Mehndi and Nikah) in July! They went
                        above and beyond on frankly everything and this is honestly the best Pakistani food
                        I've had in the US. They arrived on time for each event and helped us in the setup for each
                        event. But
                        here is where they went above and beyond, they helped us in arranging for supplies
                        (linens, plates, etc.), selecting the right menu; they helped us mix and match and
                        helped us avoid having the same items on the menu on both days. On the day of the wedding, the
                        serving tables were beautifully decorated including
                        floral arrangements for the food table. Just look at the pictures!!. And finally, we cannot
                        overstate how delicious the food was, from the desserts to
                        the bbq items to the appetizers. We got such great feedback on the food on the day
                        of the wedding and for many days after.</p>
